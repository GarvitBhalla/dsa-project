# Implementation Of Topo Sort for Couse Scheduling and Cycle Detection
When scheduling courses for a curriculum, one effective approach is to use graph theory, particularly topological sorting. This ensures that prerequisites are handled correctly, and students can take courses in a logical order. 

<h2>Topological Sorting Explanation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Topological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices in a DAG, where for every directed edge 
𝑢
𝑣
uv, vertex 
𝑢
u comes before 
𝑣
v in the ordering.</li>
<li>This sorting ensures that all prerequisite courses are scheduled before the courses that depend on them.</li>
</ul>
