# Implementation Of Topo Sort for Couse Scheduling and Cycle Detection
When scheduling courses for a curriculum, one effective approach is to use graph theory, particularly topological sorting. This ensures that prerequisites are handled correctly, and students can take courses in a logical order. 

<h2>Topological Sorting Explanation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Topological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices in a DAG, where for every directed edge 
ùë¢
ùë£
uv, vertex 
ùë¢
u comes before 
ùë£
v in the ordering.</li>
<li>This sorting ensures that all prerequisite courses are scheduled before the courses that depend on them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Algorithm Implementation</h2>
<ul>
<li>We use Depth-First Search (DFS) to perform topological sorting, which involves recursively visiting each node and its descendants</li>
<li>An alternative approach is Kahn's algorithm, which uses an iterative method with an in-degree array to maintain nodes with no incoming edges.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Handling Cycles</h2>
<ul>
<li>Detecting cycles in the graph is crucial, as the presence of a cycle indicates an impossible scheduling scenario due to circular dependencies.</li>
<li>We use cycle detection algorithms, such as checking for back edges during DFS, to ensure the graph remains a DAG</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practical Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>In a real-world scenario, courses might be offered in specific terms, and some courses might have multiple prerequisites.</li>
<li>We extend the basic topological sorting algorithm to handle such constraints, ensuring that all conditions are met for a valid schedule.</li>
</ul>
